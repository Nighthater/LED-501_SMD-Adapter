# LED-501_SMD-Adapter
Adapter Mount for the LED-501 mount from Instrument Systems  

Fit any SMD LED or other Parts onto this mount

## Requirements:
- 3D Printer (To Manufacture the Adapter and Assembly Tools, any 3D Print service also does the job)
- 2x Standard 2.54mm Female 1x2 Pin Headers 
- 2x Standard 2.54mm Male 1x2 Pin Headers
- PCBs
- SMD LEDs
- 5mm THT LED (Serves as adapter for the LED-501 mount)

## Features
- Quickly Change between different LEDs (Different PCBs Required)
- Easy and Cheap to manufacture


## Custom PCBs
If you want to test other SMD LEDs, you can create your own top Board.
Doing this is simple and can be done in any EDA Software within minutes.

- The PCB Outline is a 25mm Circle.
- The LED is placed in the exact centre of the circle.
- The Header pins are placed +/- 8.5mm from the Centre.
- Make sure the GND and VCC contacts are each on the same side as the Base PCB. (e.g. GND Both Left, VCC Both Right) You can swap polarities by roating the PCB.


## Assembly

TODO: Rewrite Assembly Guide

### Bottom PCB

- Take The Round Assembly Tool and place the PCB into the Marked Section onto the Assembly Tool.
- Insert the 5mm LED and fix it in place using tape
- Solder the LED in place
- Remove the Assembly Tool
- Use a Plier to cut off the top LED portion   
- Place the PCB into the Heaxagonal Tool
- Insert the Female 2.54mm 1x2 headers
- The Headers should face in the opposite direction from the Leads
- Place the Assembly upside down onto a flat surface, the headers are now aligned
- Solder the Headers onto the PCB   
- Glue the PCB into the Adapter Part   

### Top PCB

- Solder your SMD LED onto the Top PCB
- Insert the Male 2.54mm 1x2 headers
- The Headers should face in the opposite direction from the LED
- Put the PCB with the headers into the Base PCB
- Solder the Headers

The Adapter is now finished and ready for use
