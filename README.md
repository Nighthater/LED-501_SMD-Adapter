# LED-501_SMD-Adapter
Adapter Mount for the LED-501 mount from Instrument Systems  

Fit any SMD LED or other Parts onto this mount

## Requirements:
- 3D Printer (To Manufacture the Adapter and Assembly Tools, any 3D Print service also does the job)
- 2x Standard 2.54mm Female 1x2 Pin Headers 
- 2x Standard 2.54mm Male 1x2 Pin Headers
- PCBs
- SMD LEDs
- 5mm THT LED (Serves as adapter for the LED-501 mount)

## Optional:
- M3 Threaded Insert
- M3 Grub Screw / Thumb Screw

This allows you to mount the Adapter to the LED-501 using 2 screws for better mounting

## Features
- Sturdy Mounting Mechanism
- Quickly Change between different LEDs (Different PCBs Required)
- Easy and Cheap to manufacture


## Custom PCBs
If you want to test other SMD LEDs, you can create your own top Board.
Doing this is simple and can be done in any EDA Software within minutes.

- The PCB Outline is a 25mm Circle.
- The LED is placed in the exact centre of the circle.
- The Header pins are placed +/- 8.5mm from the Centre.
- Make sure the GND and VCC contacts are each on the same side as the Base PCB.
